## While making the webview i had made this bottom navbar like this

### Now i felt like why do we like google chrome this much huh, this bottom tab navbar, for going forward backward and all is taking too much space and our app is looking ugly, idk maybe earlier i was not able to handle backbutton events, but now i can, so if the user can go back he/she will go back, or they will be navigated to home screen. I had to make a Stack view where there was no tab bars, ans over there it was looking quite nice, until now i decided to remove that Stack webscreen too. Because i dont wnat to make the user feel the app is complicated, and what we are doin is just copy pasting the code for two screens.

So se this image and you will know how important it was to remove that bottom bar from Tab Screen, although on stack screen it looked kinda normal, but thats not the only thing i want.

### Stack Screen for WebView (Which i said looks quite normal cuz there are hardware btns and above it there is my bottom bar and abovee it  is Youtube's bottom navbar)

### TabView Screen for WebView (Okayish on Google and other websites, but looks HORRIBLE for Youtube, there are 4 bottom bars)

Also there was Incognito mode which was not working on the webview so i removed it
