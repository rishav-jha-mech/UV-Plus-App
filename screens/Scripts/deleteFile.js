// Thanks To React Native & Facebook This Does Not Work

// It does not matter if its a bit slow or less performant
// But the problem should be solved here i can't even rename Files
// Even after having full read write permission from the user

// React Native is indeed Garbage! its time to switch to JAVA ðŸ™‚
